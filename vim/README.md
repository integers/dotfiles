## Plugins

I use [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) to manage my plugins.

The plugins I have installed at the moment are:

* [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) - for the nice status line
* [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) - for fuzzy file opening
* [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) - for code autocomplete

## Colorscheme

The colorscheme I use in gVim is called Bespin. Bespin was the codename of a
former text editor by Mozilla Labs that was lastly known as [Mozilla Skywriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Skywriter)
before being merged into another project. The colorscheme that was created for
Bespin looked really good, so a user created a TextMate theme for it, that was
converted to a vim colorscheme. I made a minor tweak to it (the background color
of the line numbers on the left) and re-uploaded it on my repo, which can be
found [here](https://gitlab.com/integers/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vim/colors/bespin.vim).

The original colorscheme (converted from TextMate) can be found here: https://gist.github.com/acoffman/817896

The colorscheme I use in Konsole is called [hybrid.vim](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid).
