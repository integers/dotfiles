# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and other general configuration files.

## GNU/Linux Setup

* Web Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
* Text Editor: [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
  * [NeoVim](http://neovim.io/) seems promising. I'm also learning [GNU Emacs](https://gnu.org/software/emacs/) on the side.
* Media Player: [mpv](http://mpv.io/)
* Desktop Environment: [Xfce](http://xfce.org/)
  * Compositor: [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), because xfwm's compositor results in quite a bit of screen tearing.
