# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and other general configuration files.

## GNU/Linux Setup

* Operating System: [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
* Web Browser: [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly)
* Text Editor: [vim](https://www.vim.org/) [[Settings](vim/)]
  * [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) seems promising. I'm also learning [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) on the side.
* Terminal Emulator: [xfce4-terminal](https://docs.xfce.org/apps/terminal/start)
  * Shell: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) [[Settings](bash/bashrc)]
    * Might try out [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) eventually.
* Media Player: [mpv](https://mpv.io/) [[Settings](mpv/mpv.conf)]
* Display Manager: [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm)
* Desktop Environment: [Xfce](https://xfce.org/)
  * Compositor: [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) [[Settings](compton/compton.conf)], because other compositors (xfwm, NVIDIA, etc.) result in a lot more screen tearing.
  * GTK2/3 Theme: [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme)
  * Icon Theme: [Faenza Cupertino Dark](https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Faenza-Cupertino?content=129008)
  * Mouse Cursor Theme: [Breeze Snow](https://kver.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/curses-i-mean-cursors/)
