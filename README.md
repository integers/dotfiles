# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and other general configuration files.

## GNU/Linux Setup

* Operating System: [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
* Web Browser: [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/)
* Text Editor: [vim](http://www.vim.org/) [[Settings](vim/)]
  * [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) seems promising. I'm also learning [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) on the side.
* Terminal Emulator: [Konsole](https://userbase.kde.org/Konsole)
  * Shell: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) [[Settings](bash/bashrc)]
    * Might try out [zsh](http://zsh.org/) eventually.
* Media Player: [mpv](https://mpv.io/) [[Settings] (mpv/mpv.conf)]
* Display Manager: [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm) [[Settings](SDDM/sddm.conf)]
  * Theme: Maldives
* Desktop Environment: [Xfce](https://xfce.org/)
  * Compositor: [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) [[Settings](compton/compton.conf)], because xfwm's compositor results in quite a bit of screen tearing.
  * GTK2/3 Theme: [Greybird](https://github.com/shimmerproject/Greybird)
  * Icon Theme: [Faenza Cupertino Dark](https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Faenza-Cupertino?content=129008)
  * Mouse Cursor Theme: [Breeze Snow](https://kver.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/curses-i-mean-cursors/)
